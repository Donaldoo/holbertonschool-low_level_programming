# C - Search Algorithms
 **Search algorithm** is an algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to **retrieve information** stored within some data structure.These algorithms are mainly classified in **2 categories** according to their type of search operations. And they are:
 * **Sequential Search:** In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search
 * **Interval Search:** These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are more efficient than Linear Search method, as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in 2 half. For Example: Binary Search.

     map = malloc(sizeof(int *) * n);
     for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
     {
          map[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * m);
     }
     return (map);
