<h1 align="center">Low level programming</h1>

C is a **general-purpose high level language** that was originally **developed by Dennis Ritchie** for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer **in 1972.** The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language.
