# Recursion
**Recursion is the process which comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.** Any function which calls itself is called recursive function, and such function calls are called recursive calls. In a recursive function, there must be a termination condition that allows the function to exit without calling itself otherwise the program will run until the system gets out of memory, resulting in an error. </br>
Iterative solutions are more efficient than recursion however some problems are best suited to be solved by the recursion, e.g Fibonacci series, factorial finding, etc.
