# C - Variadic functions

**Variadic functions** are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. It takes one fixed argument and then any number of arguments can be passed. The variadic function consists of at least one fixed variable and then an elipsis (...) as the last parameter.

**Syntax:**
```
int fun_name(data_type var_name, ...);
```


*Values of the passed arguments can be accessed through the header file `stdarg.h`.*



## *Files*
*Files are programms written in **C language.***
